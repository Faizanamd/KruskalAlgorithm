# KruskalAlgorithm
The provided code implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. Here are three lines you can include in your README.md file for this code:

The KruskalAlgorithm class in this Java program implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.
The program prompts the user to enter the number of vertices and edges, followed by the details of each edge (vertex1, vertex2, weight). It then displays the MST edges with their weights.
The algorithm uses a greedy approach by sorting the edges based on their weights and adding them to the MST if they don't form a cycle. It employs the disjoint-set data structure to efficiently find the parent of a vertex.
